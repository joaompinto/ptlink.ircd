*whois
 WHOIS          - WHOIS <nick*> | <user*@host*> | <$server*>
                  Displays whois info for matched users
                  (* indicates you can use wild cards)
*lnotice
  LNOTICE       - LNOTICE :text

*squit
  SQUIT         - SQUIT <server> [reason]
                  Splits <server> away from your side of the net with
                  [reason].
*connect
  CONNECT       - CONNECT <server_A> [port] [server_B]
                  When [server_B] is used, CONNECT asks [server_B] to
                  connect to <server_A>.  Global Opers only.

                  When [server_B] is not used, CONNECT tries to connect
                  your server to <server_A>.  Local and Global Opers.

                  When [port] is used, the connection will be attempted
                  to [port].
                  When [port] is not used, 6667 is used as a default.
*trace
  TRACE         - TRACE [server|nick]
                  TRACE shows client info about [server|nick] or about
                  the server you are on if no [server|nick] is given.

                  All users that use TRACE can see the path to
                  [server|nick] if given and all servers and opers
                  connected, as well as the connection class they
                  fall into.

                  Opers can see all clients connected to a server
                  with TRACE as well as the connection class they
                  fall into.
 + LTRACE        - LTRACE [server|nick]
                  -- If compiled with LTRACE --
                  Displays only Oper, Serv, Link, and Class reports even if
                  the O-line is active.  Useful for just showing pertinent
                  info of a specific server.  Note however that if the
                  target server is not running this option then you will
                  still receive a normal trace output.
*kill
  KILL <nick> <reason>
     
  Disconnects user <nick> from the IRC server he/she
  is connected to with reason <reason>.
  Local Opers can only kill clients on his/her server.
  Global Opers can kill clients on any server on the
  IRC network.
*line 
  E: exemption from bans (exempt from K/D/G lines)
  F: exemption from connection limits
  K: Kill line (users from that mask will be killed on connect)
  X: Warn/kill lines for gecos field match
*klines
+ KLINE         - KLINE <nick|user@host> :[reason]
                  Adds a KLINE to the ircd.conf or klines.conf file which
                  will ban the specified user from using that server.
                  The banned client will receive a message saying he/she
                  is banned with reason [reason]

                  KLINE user@ip.ip.ip.ip :[reason]
                  will kline the user at the unresolved ip.
                  ip.ip.ip.ip can be in CIDR form i.e. 192.168.0.0/24
                  or 192.168.0.* (which is converted to CIDR form internally)

                  For a temporary KLINE, length of kline is given in
                  minutes as the first parameter i.e.
                  KLINE 10 <nick|user@host> :cool off for 10 minutes

+ UNKLINE       - UNKLINE <user@host>
                  Will attempt to unkline the given <user@host>
                  Will unkline a temporary kline.
*dlines
+ DLINE         - DLINE <nick|ip> :[reason]
                  Adds a DLINE to the ircd.conf or klines.conf file
                  which will deny any connections from the IP address
                  of the banned client.  The banned client will receive
                  a message saying he/she is banned with reason [reason]

                  In order to use <nick> rather than <ip>, <nick> must
                  be on your server.
*glines

                  Adding a gline will disconnect all users matching the
                  gline mask, and will forbid them to connect
                  for the specified time (default in seconds),
                  minutes, hours or days.
    
                  Adding glines
                  /GLINE user@host time[m|h|d] :reason
                  /GLINE nick time[m|h|d] :reason
                  /GLINE #chan  time[m|h|d] :reason
                  
                  Removing glines
                  /UNGLINE user@host | ALL

                  Listing glines
                  /STATS G
                     or
                  /GLINE LIST mask
*zlines

                  Adding a zline will block any incoming connections from one host
                  for the specified time (default in seconds),
                  minutes, hours our days.
				  
				  NOTE: Existing connections from the specified host will not be closed,
				  for that purpose use glines.
    
                  Adding zlines
 + ZLINE user@host time[m|h|d] :reason

                  Removing zlines
                  + UNZLINE user@host

                  Listing zlines
                  /stats Z
	
*htm
+ HTM           - HTM [option]
                  When no [option] is given, HTM shows the current
                  High Traffic Mode rate and whether HTM is on or off.

                  [option] can be one of the following:
                    ON        - Forces High Traffic Mode to be on.  With
                                this on, ircd is more efficient in
                                reading server-to-server traffic and
                                oper traffic, but will be less efficient
                                than normal with normal client traffic.
                    OFF       - Forces High Traffic Mode to be off.
                                (see above)
                    TO <rate> - Sets the High Traffic Mode rate to
                                <rate>.  Ircd will automatically go
                                into High Traffic Mode when <rate>
                                is reached, and will automatically turn
                                it off when things calm down.
                    QUIET     - When set, ircd will not notify opers
                                when it goes into and out of High
                                Traffic Mode.
                    NOISY     - When set, ircd will notify opers
                                when it goes into and out of High
                                Traffic Mode.
*set
+ SET           - SET <option> <value>
                  <option> can be one of the following:
                    LOG       - Sets the Logging level for what is logged
                                to ircd.log and syslog.
                    MAX       - Sets the number of max connections
                                to <value>.  (This number cannot exceed
                                HARD_FDLIMIT in config.h)

                    -- The following three are if compiled with FLUD --
                     FLUDNUM   - Sets the number of flud messages to
                                 trip flud alarm to <value>
                     FLUDTIME  - Sets the number of seconds in which
                                  FLUDNUM msgs must occur to <value>
                     FLUDBLOCK - Sets the number of seconds to block
                                 fluds to <value>

                    -- The following is if compiled with NO_CHANOPS_ON_SPLIT
                       or NO_JOIN_ON_SPLIT or PRESERVE_CHANNEL_ON_SPLIT
                     SPLITDELAY - Sets how long after the connect burst
                                  starts before ops can be hacked on new
                                  channels. 5(minutes) is usually plenty.
                                  Disable using 0.

                     SMALLNET   - Below this number of servers present
                                  means special split handling is now on.

                     -- The following is if compiled with ANTI_SPAMBOT
                     SPAMNUM    - Sets how many join/parts to channels
                                  constitutes a possible spambot.
                     SPAMTIME   - Below this time on a channel

*hvc
HVC stands for human verification code.
  Enabling HVC will force all users to type a /login number command
  using the number that is presented with ascii art.
  This will allow you to avoid connections from automated clients, like
  clonebots or trojans, please note that this will also deny "normal" bots
  and scripts from connecting and auto-identifying.

You can enable or disable HVC with /HVC ON | OFF .
