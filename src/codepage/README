The sources for codepage conversion can be downloaded from
http://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/ - they are ready to
be processed with `mkenc'.  The only exception is made for
`translit.enc', which has no source and is updated manually.

Codepage aliases have to be added manually after source file
is processed, that can be done with a command like:
	echo name:koi8 >> koi8u
	echo name:us_ascii >> translit
Currently, a codepage can only have one alias, the rest is
ignored.  If a number of codepages have the same alias, the
first one is selected.

Any additions to translit.enc are more than welcome at
ircd@forestnet.org, thanks in advance.
