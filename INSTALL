PTlink6 INSTALL
----------------
As of PTlink6, the distribution uses gnu autoconf instead of the old
configure script. 
NOTE: For security sake you should not run PTlink IRCd with root,
please create a normal user to install it.

0.  Read the CHANGES file to find out about the new features 
in this version.

1.  Run the configure script.  It will create include/setup.h and the
Makefiles to match your system:
	./configure
As default ircd will be installed to $HOME/ircd to specify a different
  install directory use ./configure --prefix=path/to/install/dir

2.  Edit the the "include/config.h" file.  This allows you to change
various options of how the ircd will operate.  Notes: "HARD_FDLIMIT_"
and "INIT_MAXCLIENTS" must be less than the maximum file descriptors
per process allowed by your kernel, and must be <= FD_SETSIZE (usually
defined in system includes, but may need to overridden in the Makefile.
Note that the old OS definitions are gone, autoconf handles this now.
Finally set the various PATHs to where you are going to install the ircd.
Do not install the ircd to "."--the install script is not designed to
install ircd properly on top of the existing source tree.

3.  "make" should build ircd.

4.  "make install" to install the server and tools in the path defined
in config.h.
NOTE: ircd will kill the running ircd if ircd.pid is found
	  and launch the new one with the existing .conf files.

5.
  Edit ircd.conf and *.dconf files on your ircd/etc directory
