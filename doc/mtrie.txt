In hybrid-6 dich_conf has been removed.

  All tree's K-lines/I-lines/E-lines/F-lines are now integrated
into one tree form, I have called an "mtrie." (Sean suggests
that stands for messy tree :-) )

  One lookup is done for both I-lines and K-lines in the mtrie.
The best matching ConfItem is then returned. i.e. there are no
multiple calls to tree matching routines.

  The consequences of this are the following. I-lines are now treed.
The semantics etc. are now the following.

  I lines of the form "pattern*pattern*" are unsortable, and are
searched first. This allows I lines of the form

I:NOMATCH::*@*ppp*:some_class

to be used, and to be matched first. Any pattern that includes
an '?' is also considered unsortable. Any pattern that ends
in a '*' is also considered unsortable. (i.e. ip.ip.ip.*)

  Next the best fit tree match is searched. If the aConfItem found
is "E lined" it is returned immediately. If there is no aConfItem found
there is no access anyway, and the client is rejected.

  If a K-line is found in the best fit tree match, it is returned
immediately as well.

  Then unsortable K-lines are searched, If no E lined conf was found
above.
