Virtual links allow to setup virtual server names.
Virtual server names will allow to fake various irc servers from the same 
irc net running on the same host/port depending on the client's 
connection request.
This is done by looking into the server name field sent by the client 
during on connection USER message. If the server name matches an 
existing virtual link, all messages sent to that client will look like 
originating from the virtual server. 
Note that its a single ircd process handling connections at a common 
host/port
